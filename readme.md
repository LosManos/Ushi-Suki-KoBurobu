# KoBurobu

This project is for handling blob storage in Azure

## Works on my machine

Stuff might not work.  
Other stuff might be stupendous.

It should be navigatable by keyboard.

It is a pre-v1-release. Your data == your loss.  
YOLO!

I am presently working on a M-Mac, so the other OSs are untested. Please test and feedback!

## Features

Se [manual](manual.md) for detailed instructions.

Open an blob storage. Browse around. Dive in.  

Keyboard shortcuts should be discoverable through mouseover tooltips.

Cmd-E brings you back to the list on the left.

Shift-space opens the menu.

Alt-enter is typically a context menu.

Cmd-I is typically info.

## Security

The secrets are stored in respective operating system's safe haven.

## Mac

I have not  payed the 100USD/year licens for being an Apple developer so the code is unsigned. That means MacOS will complain with a dialogue "...broken file...". That can be remedied by  
`sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Koburobu.app`
