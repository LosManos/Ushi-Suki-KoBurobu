# keyboard shortcuts

The whole application should be navigatable by keyboard.

Buttons and other controls the user can interact with should have keyboard shortcuts.

The shortcut must be explorable, that is the user can find it without reading the manual. A good way for this is to have a tooltip describing the keyboard shortcut.

The manual must contain list of these shortcuts.

## dialoges

Dialogues are typically closed with esc for bailing out, and enter for updating.

Dialogues with only information can be closed with either.

# manual

There must be a file `manual.md` describing how to use the application.
